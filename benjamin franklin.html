        <p>Benjamin Franklin was one of the Founding Fathers and a polymath, inventor, scientist, printer, politician, freemason and he has a<br>
           diplomat.  Franklin was one of those people who helped draft the Declaration of Independence and the US constitutes.  Franklin negotiated<br>
           the Treaty of Paris in 1783 which helped end the Revolutionary War.  His scientific investigations include electricity, maths, and mapmaking.<br>
           Franklin was a famous for being a clever writer.  One of his famous works were "Poor Richard's Almanack".</p><br><br>
        <p>Benjamin Franklin was born on January 17 1706 in colonial Boston.  Franklin was the eight child out of the ten children his father Josiah Franklin<br>
           has in his second marriage.  Franklin received very little formal education and his education ended when he was ten-years-old.  This was not a problem<br>
           for Franklin because he was a bookworm and became a writer through self-taught.</p><br><br>
        <p>In 1740s, Benjamin Franklin conducted experiments on electricity so that he could understand it further.  Franklin invented the lightning rod that<br>
           protects buildings from fires produced by lightning.  In 1752, he conducted a famous experiment which is flying a kite until a lightning struck the<br>
           kite and electrocuted him.  Franklin formed a lot of electrical related terms like battery, charge and conductor.</p><v\br><br>
        <p>Besides that, Benjamin Franklin studied ocean currents, meteorology, causes of common cold and refrigeration.  Franklin invented a stove that more heat<br>
           requiring less fuel and bifocal glasses that have two purposes.  Bifocal glasses are used for reading and allows the wearer to see people or things at a<br>
           distant clearly.  In 1760s Franklin invented a musical instrument called "armonica".  Wolfgang and Mozart wrote songs about it but in the 19th century the instrument<br>
           became useless.</p><br><br>
        <p>Franklin died on April 17 1790, in Philadelphia at the age of 84.  Franklin suffered from gout and complained about his food intake.  Franklin gave Sarah Bache (his daughter),<br>
           most of the property in his will which he has written a year and a half before his death.  Franklin donated money to schools, scholarships, and museum in Philadelphia and Boston.<br>
