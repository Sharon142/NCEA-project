      <h1><b>Rosalind Franklin</b></h1>
      <p>Rosalind Elsie Franklin was born on July 25 1920 in London, England.  Rosalind Franklin died on April 16, 1958 London.  She was a British scientist and a chemist known for her discovery of the molecular<br> structure of DNA.  Franklin also gave a new insight to the structure of viruses which helped to build foundation of the virology structure.  Franklin attended St Paul's Girls' College before pursuing her studies<br> in physical chemistry at the University of Cambridge. Franklin graduated in 1941 and received a companionship to research in physical chemistry.  The following year, Franklin became an air-raid warden due<br> to World War II and used this opportunity to investigate the physical chemistry between carbon and coal.  Franklin joined the Biophysical Laboratory in King's College 1951 to conduct a research study on DNA using X-ray diffraction methods.  This successfully helped her discover the structure of DNA.</p>

<p>Sadly, the credit goes to James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins for the Noble Prize 1962.  Only a letter written by Crick "the data which really helped us to obtain the structure was mainly obtained<br> by Rosalind Franklin."  The reason she did not get the Noble Prize was because she did not get along with Maurice Wilkins (her colleague) while they were working to uncover the structure of the DNA.  However, they made a lot of progress.  In May 1952, she took a photograph of the famous DNA structure (photograph 51).  James Watson and Francis Crick stole her data and published <br>it as their own work through "a paper in Nature" and only credited Franklin and Wilkins as their helpers.  The reason we know this is because Watson himself have cheerfully described his actions were burglary.  Maurice Wilkins regretted his actions and he was angry with James Watson and Francis Crick but Watson said that this was a wakeup call and <br>Wilkins should not be so upset because they were only friends.</p>

<p>Around this time Rosalind Franklin left King’s College for the Birkbeck College crystallography laboratory.  Franklin studied the structure of the tobacco mosaic virus where she became successful and was<br> asked to create virus models to display at the 1958 Brussels World’s Fair Science Exhibition.  Franklin died at 38 due to ovarian cancer (few years before Wilkins, Watson, and Crick received the Noble Prize Award).  The inscription on her tombstone states: “Her work on viruses was a lasting benefit to mankind”.  Her reputation and her legacy grew and spread.  This creates a rise in the feminist movement and a<br> strong response to James Watson’s portrayal which is a memoir called “The Double Helix”.  Despite missing out on an award, Rosalind Franklin’s name is remembered through awards, science institutes, and a<br> university in Chicago.  Franklin’s legacy will continue to extend in space where a space rover in Mars will be named after her.  </p>
