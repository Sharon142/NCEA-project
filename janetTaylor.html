        <h1>Janet Taylor</h1>
           <p>Janet Taylor (1804-1870) was a navigation teacher and an instrument maker two centuries ago.  Despite working in a
           male-dominated field (navigation was a male-dominated field in the 19th century), she has gained acceptance and a good reputation.
           Taylor first received her education by her father, Reverend Peter Ionn in Wolsingham Free Grammar School.  Due to the patronage Queen
           Charlotte, she could attend Ampthill School when she was only nine years old.</p><br><br>
           <p>When Taylor was 32 years old she opened up a private school and warehouse in London filled with sea charts, instruments and
           chronometers.  Two years ago, Taylor invented an instrument called the Mariner's Calculator.  In 1845, she had maritime instruments
           made in her shop.  Due to her growing reputation, Janet Taylor was assigned to write a book on prepare mariners in training, especially
           for her colleagues and masters.  The title of her book is "Hand-Book to the Local Marine Board Examination, for the Officers of the British
           Mercantile Marine: Including the New Regulations for Masters and Mates in the Coasting Trade. A Diagram Illustrating Current Sailing, and
           Directions for Working the Tides; with Full and Complete Answers to the Questions in Steam".</p><br><br>
           <p>In January 1845, the family and the business moved next door and Taylor changed the house address the following month.  This is
            significant in the Victorian era, because one of the ways Taylor built her reputation is through writing.  However, men built their
            reputation through experience.  In 1833, Taylor produced her first navigational textbook which is "Luni-Solar and Horary Tables".  This
            book was so successful that Taylor received £100 from the Trinity and Admiralty House each to help her publish more.  In 1835, the Taylor
            family moved to 103 Minores. In 1860, she was granted a civil Pension of £50 for her contribution in Minores.</p><br><br>
           <p>Despite the recognition she received, Taylor knew it would be difficult to establish herself in a field that is dominated by males.  Therefore,
            when she wrote her first book "Luni-solar and horary tables: with their application in nautical astronomy; containing an easy and correct method of finding
            the longitude, by lunar observations and chronometers; the latitude, by double altitudes and elapsed time, the azimuth, amplitude, and true time".  In her first
            book Taylor referred to herself as "he" not "she".</p><br><br>
            <p>Janet Taylor was highlighted in Women's magazine's due to her contribution in the navigation field.  Taylor's work was considered to be "will be found extremely
               useful, which is perhaps the highest and, in fact, the sweetest fame".  When Taylor was acknowledged in the "The Lady's Magazine" and this will have a huge appeal to
               the female audience from middle-class.  Taylor's first recognition would have given her confidence to name her next academy after herself. </p>
