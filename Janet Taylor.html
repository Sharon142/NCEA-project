        <h1>Janet Taylor</h1>
           <p>Janet Taylor (1804-1870) was a navigation teacher and an instrument maker two centuries ago.  Despite working in a<br>
           male-dominated field (navigation was a male-dominated field in the 19th century), she has gained acceptance and a good reputation.<br>
           Taylor first received her education by her father, Reverend Peter Ionn in Wolsingham Free Grammar School.  Due to the patronage Queen<br>
           Charlotte, she could attend Ampthill School when she was only nine years old.</p><br><br>
           <p>When Taylor was 32 years old she opened up a private school and warehouse in London filled with sea charts, instruments and<br>
           chronometers.  Two years ago, Taylor invented an instrument called the Mariner's Calculator.  In 1845, she had maritime instruments<br>
           made in her shop.  Due to her growing reputation, Janet Taylor was assigned to write a book on prepare mariners in training, especially<br>
           for her colleagues and masters.  The title of her book is "Hand-Book to the Local Marine Board Examination, for the Officers of the British<br>
           Mercantile Marine: Including the New Regulations for Masters and Mates in the Coasting Trade. A Diagram Illustrating Current Sailing, and<br>
           Directions for Working the Tides; with Full and Complete Answers to the Questions in Steam".</p><br><br>
           <p>In January 1845, the family and the business moved next door and Taylor changed the house address the following month.  This is<br>
            significant in the Victorian era, because one of the ways Taylor built her reputation is through writing.  However, men built their<br>
            reputation through experience.  In 1833, Taylor produced her first navigational textbook which is "Luni-Solar and Horary Tables".  This<br>
            book was so successful that Taylor received £100 from the Trinity and Admiralty House each to help her publish more.  In 1835, the Taylor<br>
            family moved to 103 Minores. In 1860, she was granted a civil Pension of £50 for her contribution in Minores.</p><br><br>
           <p>Despite the recognition she received, Taylor knew it would be difficult to establish herself in a field that is dominated by males.  Therefore,<br>
            when she wrote her first book "Luni-solar and horary tables: with their application in nautical astronomy; containing an easy and correct method of finding<br>
            the longitude, by lunar observations and chronometers; the latitude, by double altitudes and elapsed time, the azimuth, amplitude, and true time".  In her first<br>
            book Taylor referred to herself as "he" not "she".</p><br><br>
            <p>Janet Taylor was highlighted in Women's magazine's due to her contribution in the navigation field.  Taylor's work was considered to be "will be found extremely<br>
               useful, which is perhaps the highest and, in fact, the sweetest fame".  When Taylor was acknowledged in the "The Lady's Magazine" and this will have a huge appeal to<br>
               the female audience from middle-class.  Taylor's first recognition would have given her confidence to name her next academy after herself. </p>
