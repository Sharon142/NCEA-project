        <h1>Thomas Edison</h1>
        <div class="w3-display-container"></div>
        <div><p>Thomas Edison was a leading inventor and businessman credited for building the American economy
           during the Industrial Revolution.  Edison also rivalled with Nikola Tesla due to the different electrical
           currents they have invented.  Edison was born on 11 February 1847, Milan, Ohio.  He was the youngest child
           of Samuel and Nancy Edison.  Edison was nearly deaf in his adulthood after encountering a train accident.</p>
        <p>One of Edison's invention was the automatic telegraph.  The telegraph was first invented by Samuel.  This 
           invention was used in the 1830's and 1840's.  However, there were some disadvantages, the operator had to
           listen to dots and dashes of Morse Code slowing the words recorded per minute to 25-40.  Later on, a British
           system telegraph was invented but it recorded 120 words per minute.  Edison has developed a telegraph system
           that is far more efficient than these two inventions.  It could record 1000 words in a minute.</p>
        <p>Automobiles were famous during the late 1800s electric vehicles became more usable than gasoline-internal 
           burning combustion energy.  Electrical vehicles require heavy batteries that leak acid.  This was a huge
           disadvantage because the leaked acid will corrode the interiors of the cars.  Edison decided to invent a 
           battery that was dependable, lighter and more powerful.  After doing a lot of research and failed designed
           attempts, Edison invented a reliable alkaline battery that became of use in 1910.  Despite being 
           overshadowed by Henry Ford's development, Edison's battery was used in mining lamps, trains, and submarines.
           This became one of his successful inventions in his later career.</p>
        <p>Edison and Tesla have been rivals for a long time.  Both of them have publicly clashed in the "War of 
           Currents" where Edison supported the use of direct current but Tesla favoured alternative current.  Tesla
           formed a partnership with George Westinghouse creating a massive business feud with Edison over electrical
           power.  One of the most unusual means Edison has used to encourage people to use direct current for the 
           fair is elephant killing.  Edison has used Topsy, a circus elephant for electrocution in 1903.</p>
        <p>Edison died when he was 84 in New Jersey on October 18, 1931 due in diabetes.  In order to honour him on the
            day he died, many communities around the world dimmed their lights or cut off their electrical supply.  
            During his lifetime, Thomas Edison may be arrogant, an attention-seeker, and harsh to his employees but he
            became one of the most respected Americans in the world.</p></div>
