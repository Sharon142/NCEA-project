        <h1>Thomas Edison</h1>
        <p>Thomas Edison was a leading inventor and businessman credited for<br>
           building the American economy during the Industrial Revolution.  Edison also rivalled with Nikola Tesla<br>
           due to the different electrical currents they have invented.  Edison was born on 11 February 1847, Milan,<br>
           Ohio.  He was the youngest child of Samuel and Nancy Edison.  Edison was nearly deaf in his adulthood after<br>
           encountering a train accident.</p><br><br>
        <p>One of Edison's invention was the automatic telegraph.  The telegraph was first invented by Samuel.  This invention<br>
           was used in the 1830's and 1840's.  However, there were some disadvantages, the operator had to listen to dots and<br>
           dashes of Morse Code slowing the words recorded per minute to 25-40.  Later on, a British system telegraph was invented<br>
           but it recorded 120 words per minute.  Edison has developed a telegraph system that is far more efficient than these two inventions.<br>
           It could record 1000 words in a minute.</p><br><br>
        <p>Automobiles were famous during the late 1800s electric vehicles became more usable than gasoline-internal burning combustion energy.<br>
           Electrical vehicles require heavy batteries that leak acid.  This was a huge disadvantage because the leaked acid will corrode the interiors<br>
           of the cars.  Edison decided to invent a battery that was dependable, lighter and more powerful.  After doing a lot of research and failed designed<br>
           attempts, Edison invented a reliable alkaline battery that became of use in 1910.  Despite being overshadowed by Henry Ford's development, Edison's battery<br>
           was used in mining lamps, trains, and submarines.  This became one of his successful inventions in his later career.</p><br><br>
        <p>Edison and Tesla have been rivals for a long time.  Both of them have publicly clashed in the "War of Currents" where Edison supported the use of direct current<br>
           but Tesla favoured alternative current.  Tesla formed a partnership with George Westinghouse creating a massive business feud with Edison over electrical power.<br>
           One of the most unusual means Edison has used to encourage people to use direct current for the fair is elephant killing.  Edison has used Topsy, a circus elephant<br>
           for electrocution in 1903.</p><br><br>
        <p>Edison died when he was 84 in New Jersey on October 18, 1931 due in diabetes.  In order to honour him on the day he died, many communities around the world dimmed their<br>
           lights or cut off their electrical supply.  During his lifetime, Thomas Edison may be arrogant, an attention-seeker, and harsh to his employees but he became one of the most<br>
           respected Americans in the world.</p><br><br>
