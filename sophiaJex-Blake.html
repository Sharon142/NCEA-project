        <h1>Sophia Louisa Jex-Blake</h1>
        <div><p>Sophia Louisa Jex-Blake is known as "one of the Edinburgh seven" who fought to study medicine.
             She was born in January 21, 1840, Hastings, Sussex.  Jex-Blake was a British Physician who opened 
             up a medical school for woman in London, 1874.  Jex-Blake also established another medical school in
             Edinburgh.  Jex-Blake studied in Queen's College for 3 years in Boston and New York and came back to
             England in 1868.  She studied hard and passed her exams.  However, the university did not allow women
             to own medical degrees.  Nevertheless, Jex-Blake became a doctor in 1877.</p>
        <p>Growing up, Jex-Blake was smart and witty who was always keen to learn and study.  Jex-Blake has been
           transferred from numerous schools multiple.  The two reasons were the schools were preparing girls for
           motherhood and homemakers and there were often personality clashes between Jex-Blake and her teachers and
           mother.  Nevertheless, Jex-Blake has developed a strong bond with her parents.  As it was written by
           Margaret Todd, a biographer, Jex-Blake has stated "No one has better parents than I" about her parents.</p>
        <p>Jex-Blake was interested in tutoring, one of the few professions open to women.  When she entered Queen's 
           College she encountered her first challenge.  Jex-Blake enjoyed tutoring and she loves Mathematics.  She met
           Octavia Hill and the two of them developed a close friendship and began living together.  Sadly, the
           friendship did not last and Hill moved out leaving a depressed Jex-Blake behind.  While dealing with her 
           grief, Jex-Blake considered her educational options.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Jex-Blake researched about women's history studying medicine and published a book titled 
           "Medicine as a Profession for Women".  In 1869, she was admitted into the University of Edinburgh but later
           the university expelled her because she was a women.  This has cause Jex-Blake to start a forceful campaign
           which attracted global attention.  Jex-Blake led several other students as well to file a lawsuit, they won
           the lawsuit but lost the appeal.  Therefore, they took it to the parliament and they won after a hard fight.</p>
        <p>After receiving founding The London School of Medicine for Women in 1874, Jex-Blake became a huge 
           disappointed to the girls learning under the school which she and Garrett Anderson have founded.  This was
           due to the fact that Jex-Blake was a spontaneous leader who ruled with an iron-fist.  Jex-Blake was expected
           to be The London School Sectary but Anderson was favoured.  This is because Garett Anderson was not as 
           hot-tempered as Jex-Blake.</p>
        <p>Jex-Blake left London for Edinburgh and became a private practitioner.  She left her responsibility for her 
           young assistant in 1881 because Maria Jex-Blake ( her mother) died.  Jex-Blake's assistant died because of
           the toxicity of the experiment regarding the insolubility of fats.  Feeling depressed, Jex-Blake moved in
           Ursula Dupr√©'s (her friend) home for two years.  Dupre nursed back Jex-Blake's physical and mental health
           and Jex-Blake moved to Edinburgh to continue her practice.  Jex-Blake wrote "The care of infants" and 
           "Medical Women".</p>
        <p>In 1894, the Edinburgh University allowed female students to sit medical barriers closing another gender gap.
           Furthermore, the National Association for the Medical Education of Women honoured Jex-Blake for dedicating
           25 years to women's medical education.  Sadly, it closed down due to low enrolment in 1898.  Nonetheless,
           Jex-Blake continued her practice and retired the following year when she was 59.  Jex-Blake lived with
           Margaret Todd who was her student 20 years younger than Jex-Blake.  Todd was a novelist who gave up her
           medical career 5 years after starting it.  Both women spent time reading, writing letters and socializing
           with friends.</p>
        <p>Jex-Blake was proud of her students success and frequently addressed them as "my daughters", "my doctors",
           or "my young girls".  Jex-Blake wrote to hundreds of people and wrote about her life in a huge amount of
           diaries.  Jex-Blake died after suffering a series of heart attacks at the age of 71.  Jex-Blake wrote all
           of her letters and possessions in her will to Margaret Todd.  Due to Jex-Blake's wishes, Todd wrote a
           biography about her and burnt all of her personal letters once the biography was published.  Todd committed
           suicide the same year Jex-Blake died she was 58.</p></div>
