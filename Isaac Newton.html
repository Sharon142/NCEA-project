      <h1><b>Isaac Newton</b></h1>
<p>Isaac Newton was born in January 4 1643 and died March 31 1727 when he was 84 years old.  When Newton was three months old, his father died and his mother Hannah Ayscough Newton was remarried to<br> Barnabas Smith.  Hannah Ayscough left Newton with his grandmother.  Newton was reunited with his mother who brought three children from her second marriage after twelve years.  </p>

<p>Despite being interested in Chemistry, his mother pulled out of King's School to manage farming.  However, Newton failed because he found the work too tedious and boring.  Therefore, he was sent back to<br> school to finish is primary education.  After sensing Newton's potential, his uncle persuaded his mother to enroll him into university.</p>

<p>Isaac Newton has done major contributions in STEM through his field of study.  They are optics, calculus, and mechanics.  Newton is best known for his discovery of gravity which is the universal force of<br> attraction that acts between all matter.  Newton studied in the University of Cambridge until the Black Plague that has caused the university to shut down.  He returned home and purposed the theories which he is <br>best known for.  </p>

<p>One of them was the discovery of gravity.  This occurred when an apple fell on top of Newton's head while he was sitting under a tree.   His theory of gravity was: the larger the object is, the greater the force of <br>gravity.  In his contribution of optics, he is known for the phenomena's of the colours in white light.   He has discovered that the colours in white light are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.  This<br> has made him lay foundation in modern physics.  </p>

<p>Isaac Newton's first important science achievement was designing and constructing a reflective telescope in 1668.  This was his contribution in optics.  He has chosen optics as his main topic in his course of<br> lecture.  During this time, he came out with many theories about light and used his telescope that he has invented to prove that he was right.  In 1671, the Royal Society asked Newton to publish his notes on light,<br> optics and colour the following year.  </p>

<p>During his final years, Newton lived with his niece Catherine Barton Conduitt and her husband John Conduitt.  This made Newton a wealthy and famous man in Europe.  Newton has a huge amount of money and<br> most of it was given to charity and his discoveries was not challenged.  Newton died at the age of 80 due to severe digestive problems.  This has affected his diet and his mobility he experienced severe pains at<br> his abdomen and died on 31 March 1727.</p>
