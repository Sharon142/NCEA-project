        <h1>Grace Hopper</h1>
        <h2>1906-1992</h2>
        <p>Grace Murray Hopper was a very curious child because she would take apart household items and try fixing them again.  Hopper's parents did not know that her<br>
           curiosity would eventually lead her to computer science.  She was born on 9 December 1906.  Hopper attended primary school in New Jersey.  Later on, Hopper did<br>
           her Bachelor's Degree in Vascar College.  Hopper completed her PhD and Masters in Maths at University of Yale.  Hopper returned to Vascar College to teach once she<br>
           completed her PhD and Masters in the University of Yale.</p><br><br>
        <p>During World War I, Grace Hopper was part of the US Navy Reserve and joined the Mark 1 computer programming staff.  While working on the Mark 2 computer, a moth was<br>
           stuck inside.  Grace removed it saying she was "debugging the system".  Hopper joined the another computer programming staff which was tasked to build another computer<br>
           for commercial use.  The second computer was called "UNIFAC 1".</p><br><br>
        <p>One of her pioneering work was UNIVAC.  It was a first all-electronic digital computer.  Hopper also invented the first computer compiler.  The computer compiler would<br>
           translate written language into computer coding directly.  Hopper became one of the developers for COBOL which allows the computer to respond in words and numbers.  Hopper<br>
           gave 300 lectures yearly and predicted and computers would one day be small enough to fit a desk.  Hopper also predicted that everyone (including non-computer programmers)<br>
           would use it on a daily basis.</p><br>
        <p>In 1957, Hopper developed FLOW-MATIC the first English language data processing computer compiler.  Since she has publicly supported COBOL, the usage increased in the 1960s.<br>
           Hopper retired in 1966 but she was called back again to help standardize the computer language.  She became a commodore in  1983 and a rear admiral two years later.  Hopper retired<br>
           in 1986 at the age of 79, making her the oldest active American Naval Officer.</p><br>
        <p>In 1962, Hopper elected a fellow Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers and earned the title "Man of the Year" in computer science.  In 1991, she received an award for National<br>
           Medal of Technology.  During that time, she has stated "If you ask me what accomplishment I’m most proud of, the answer would be all the young people I’ve trained over the years; that’s more<br>
           important than writing the first compiler.".  After Hopper's death, in 2016, she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p><br>
