           has in his second marriage.  Franklin received very little formal education and his education ended when he was ten-years-old.  This was not a problem<br>
           for Franklin because he was a bookworm and became a writer through self-taught.</p><br><br>
        <p>In 1740s, Benjamin Franklin conducted experiments on electricity so that he could understand it further.  Franklin invented the lightning rod that<br>

           distant clearly.  In 1760s Franklin invented a musical instrument called "armonica".  Wolfgang and Mozart wrote songs about it but in the 19th century the instrument<br>
           became useless.</p><br><br>
        <p>Franklin died on April 17 1790, in Philadelphia at the age of 84.  Franklin suffered from gout and complained about his food intake.  Franklin gave Sarah Bache (his daughter),<br>
