           politician, freemason and he has a diplomat.  Franklin was one of those people who helped draft the
           Declaration of Independence and the US constitutes.  Franklin negotiated the Treaty of Paris in 1783
           which helped end the Revolutionary War.  His scientific investigations include electricity, maths, and
           mapmaking.  Franklin was a famous for being a clever writer.  One of his famous works were "Poor 
           Richard's Almanack".</p>
        <p>Benjamin Franklin was born on January 17 1706 in colonial Boston.  Franklin was the eight child out
           of the ten children his father Josiah Franklin has in his second marriage.  Franklin received very
           little formal education and his education ended when he was ten-years-old.  This was not a problem 
           for Franklin because he was a bookworm and became a writer through self-taught.</p>
        <p>In 1740s, Benjamin Franklin conducted experiments on electricity so that he could understand it
           further.  Franklin invented the lightning rod that protects buildings from fires produced by 
           lightning.  In 1752, he conducted a famous experiment which is flying a kite until a lightning
           struck the kite and electrocuted him.  Franklin formed a lot of electrical related terms like
           battery, charge and conductor.</p>
        <p>Besides that, Benjamin Franklin studied ocean currents, meteorology, causes of common cold and
           refrigeration.  Franklin invented a stove that more heat requiring less fuel and bifocal glasses
           that have two purposes.  Bifocal glasses are used for reading and allows the wearer to see people or
           things at a distant clearly.  In 1760s Franklin invented a musical instrument called "armonica".  
           Wolfgang and Mozart wrote songs about it but in the 19th century the instrument became useless.</p>
        <p>Franklin died on April 17 1790, in Philadelphia at the age of 84.  Franklin suffered from gout and 
           complained about his food intake.  Franklin gave Sarah Bache (his daughter), most of the property in
           his will which he has written a year and a half before his death.  Franklin donated money to schools,
           scholarships, and museum in Philadelphia and Boston.  Franklin shared his tombstone with his wife Deborah
           Franklin.</p></div>
